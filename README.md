# Employee-Tracker
The task at hand is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a companyâ€™s employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This application was created in order to demonstrate the proper functionality of the use of being able to display all the various information that would be seen when having an employee database in order to manage for viewing and further edits in regards to employee status of the company. This project proved to be extremely challenging due to assumptions all necessary skills would provide a simple more straight solution path in order when creating a database to display tables of various information. The project proved that wrong and was much more challenging and more intuitive than initially thought of. This project was a first time attempt at using MySQL and being able to demonstrate the correct implementation of a database with various values that were included such as the inclusion of employees, roles, managers, and various information needed. Lots of attempts proved trial and error with more time dedicated for various research for the project. In time skills will be perfected for future experiences and all lessons learned from creating this command-line application will prove to be useful for further applications regarding the same criteria.
